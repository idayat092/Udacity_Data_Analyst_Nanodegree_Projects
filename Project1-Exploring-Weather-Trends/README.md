## PROJECT TITLE - EXPLORING WEATHER CONDITIONS

**This project demonstrates the use SQL for data extraction, using excel for calculating moving average and for visualization.**

I will be comparing data between (Lagos, Nigeria; Tucson, United States; Toronto, Canada; and the global average) within the period 1873 and 2013.
This period was chosen because that is the period common to the three cities without null data. 

I decided to compare Lagos with Toronto because of its cold weather which very low and also selected Tucson because it is one of the hottest cities in United States.

The data will be compared using a 5years moving average so as to see the variations as much as possible while avoiding the use of individual average.

The summary file includes the scripts used for extraction, visualization and Observations.
